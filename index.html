          <p class="faqbox bodytext start" id="a1">A hackathon is an event where people get together to work on developing software projects in a short amount of time, usually between 24-36 hours. Participants form a team, come up with an idea, plan for their idea and then implement the code for it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqbox" id="faqbox2">

        </div>
        <div class="faqbox" id="faqbox5">
          <h1 class="faqbox bodytext mid" id="q5">What should I bring?</h1>
          <p class="faqbox bodytext mid" id="a5">Please bring a student or government-issued ID, a laptop, phone and charger for both. Also, since this is an overnight event, you may want to bring a change of clothes, sleeping bag and toiletries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqbox" id="faqbox6">
          <h1 class="faqbox bodytext end" id="q6">What if I don't have an idea?</h1>
          <p class="faqbox bodytext end" id="a6">You are not expected to come to the hackathon with a complete idea! We will have mentors around to help participants think of ideas and implement them. There will also be time for brainstorming at the beginning of the event.</p>

          <p class="faqbox bodytext mid" id="a8">Applications for BuildHer will be going live late February.

After applications close, we will review all the applicants and send out our responses promptly.</p>
