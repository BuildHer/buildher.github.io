<!--Mission Section-->
<div class="row about">
	<h3 class="header-text">Our Mission</h3>
	<p class="about body-text">BuildHer was founded with the intent of promoting diversity and inclusion within the tech community in the Chicago area. BuildHer will serve as a space for female, nonbinary and transgender beginner coders to learn with the encouragement and guidance of other femme coders, and for more experienced coders to explore interdisciplinary applications of technology, regardless of their individual career paths or majors. </p>
	<p class="about body-text">Coding is not something that is limited in its usefulness to computer scientists - instead, we constantly hear of entrepreneurs making their own app for their business, or artists mixing traditional mediums with digital ones. BuildHer wants newcomers and experts alike to experiment with using code in different contexts and to walk away with the skills to use throughout their life. </p>
